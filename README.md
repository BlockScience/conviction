This is a repository for Research on Conviction voting schemes.

## What is Conviction Voting?
Conviction Voting is a novel decision making process used to estimate real-time collective preference in a distributed work proposal system. Voters continuously express their preference by staking tokens in support of proposals they would like to see approved, with the conviction (i.e. weight) of their vote growing over time. Collective conviction accumulates until it reaches an algorithmically set threshold based on the proportion of funds requested by a proposal. When conviction accumulates past the threshold, the proposal passes and funds are released so work may begin.

Conviction voting improves on traditional discrete voting processes by allowing participants to vote at any time, and eliminates the need for group consensus on every proposal.
